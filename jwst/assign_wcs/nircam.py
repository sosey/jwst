    Create the WCS pipeline for a NIRCAM grism observation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_model: jwst.datamodels.ImagingModel, CubeModel
        The input datamodel, derived from datamodels
    reference_files: dict
        Dictionary {reftype: reference file name}.

    Notes
    -----
    The tree in the grism reference file has a section for each order/beam
    not sure if there will be a separate passband reference file needed for
    the wavelength scaling or wedge offsets. This helper is currently in
    jwreftools/nircam/nircam_reftools

    The direct image the catalog has been created from was corrected for
    distortion, but the dispersed images have not. This is OK if the trace and
    dispersion solutions are defined with respect to the distortion-corrected
    image. The catalog from the combined direct image has object locations in
    in detector space and the RA DEC of the object on sky.

    The WCS information for the grism image  plus the observed filter will be
    used to translate these to pixel locations for each of the objects.
    The grism images will then use their grism trace information to translate
    to detector space. The translation is assumed to be one-to-one for purposes
    of identifying the center of the object trace.

    The extent of the trace for each object can then be calculated based on
    the grism in use (row or column). Where the left/bottom of the trace starts
    at t = 0 and the right/top of the trace ends at t = 1, as long as they
    have been defined as such by th team.

    The extraction box is calculated to be the minimum bounding box of the
    object extent in the segmentation map associated with the direct image.
    The values of the min and max corners are saved in the photometry
    catalog in units of RA,DEC so they can be translated to pixels by
    the dispersed image's imaging wcs.

    For each spectral order, the configuration file contains a
    magnitude-cutoff value. Sources with magnitudes fainter than the
    extraction cutoff (MMAG_EXTRACT)  will not be extracted, but are
    accounted for when computing the spectral contamination and background
    estimates. The default extraction value is 99 right now.

    The sensitivity information from the original aXe style configuration
    file needs to be modified by the passband of the filter used for
    the direct image to get the min and max wavelengths
    which correspond to t=0 and t=1, this currently has been done by the team
    and the min and max wavelengths to use to calculate t are stored in the
    grism reference file as wrange, which can be selected by wrange_selector
    which contains the filter names.


    All the following was moved to the extract_2d stage
    Step 1: Convert the source catalog from the reference frame of the
            uberimage to that of the dispersed image.  For the Vanilla
            Pipeline we assume that the pointing information in the file
            headers is sufficient.  This will be strictly true if all images
            were obtained in a single visit (same guide stars).
    Step 2: Record source information for each object in the catalog: position
            (RA and Dec), shape (A_IMAGE, B_IMAGE, THETA_IMAGE), and all
            available magnitudes.
    Step 3: Compute the trace and wavelength solutions for each object in the
            catalog and for each spectral order.  Record this information.
    Step 4: Compute the WIDTH of each spectral subwindow, which may be fixed or
            variable (see discussion of optimal extraction, below).  Record
            this information.
